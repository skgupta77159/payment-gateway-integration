* Create a simple website where payment gateway is integrated.
* There will be a simple donate button on homepage. On clicking 
the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where 
user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. 
credit card, Paypal, etc.
* Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email
will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will 
contain the amount.
